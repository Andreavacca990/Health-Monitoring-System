The project aims to continuously monitor the vital parameters of elderly residents in a nursing home.
It uses an ESP32 board to collect data from a smartwatch worn by the patients, such as steps, calories burned, heart rate, and blood pressure.
The data is then processed by an ESP8266 board and stored in a noSQL database on Amazon AWS.
The goal is to increase the frequency of data collection to quickly detect early signs of potential illness and alert trusted staff in case of potentially dangerous situations.
